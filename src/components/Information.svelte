    In environmental zones, you would normally expect more awareness for environmentally friendly transportation:
    the goal of these zones is to reduce polution. The Netherlands has 13 of these so-called environmental zones.
    By combining data, we can see the difference between parkings inside environmental zones and the ones outside environmental zones.

  <h2>What makes a parking area more environmentally friendly?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Charging points</li>
    <li>Good accessibility to public transport (park & ride)</li>
    <li>Higher cost to park (assumption: motivate public transport)</li>
  </ul>
